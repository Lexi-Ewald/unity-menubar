## Unity Menubar
### for Firefox and Thunderbird with global menu

**Histroy**
- Unity was developed by Mozilla and introduced in Ubuntu 11.04, which was released on May 12, 2011.
- The Mozilla-Ubuntu-Team maintained the unity-menubar up to Firefox-esr version 115.13.0, from Firefox-trunk version 121.0 onwards the patch was no longer developed and was removed.

**Notes:**
- Global menu on Unity seems to require `libdbusmenu-{qt5,gtk3}` and/or `appmenu-gtk-module` packages.
- Unity-menubar.patch is tested for version 127.0.*
